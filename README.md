This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick start

In the project directory:

### Install dependencies

- `npm install`

### Start application
- `npm start`

### Backend
- the application consumes the API available at: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/talitastravassos/users-API/users/
- changes (delete, put, post) are faked and aren't persisted

#### To make real changes:
- run `json-server --watch db.json` at the root of the project, and change the commented line in baseURL variable in ./API/requests.js.
- start application.
